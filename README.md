# Aigate

Welcome to **Aigate** - a playful, challenging project where you must prove you're a robot to gain access! This site is designed to test your ability to think and act like a machine through a series of unconventional tasks 🦾

## Project Overview

**Aigate** flips traditional CAPTCHA challenges on their head. Instead of proving you're human, you need to prove you can think like a robot. With a mix of logic puzzles, precision tasks, and binary code challenges, this site will make you question your own humanity - or at least your mouse skills!

## **How to Play**

1. **Navigate** through the site by solving the challenges presented on each page.
2. **Prove your robotic nature** by successfully completing tasks designed to stump human users.
3. **Earn your place** in the robot-exclusive area by thinking logically, acting with precision, and bypassing all human limitations!

Visit the site at [heliacer.github.io/aigate](https://heliacer.github.io/aigate) and see if you have what it takes to join the robots! 🤖
